and the fast reflexes required of the  player. This has to be changed.
Advertisements should promote  the device as a learning  and educa-

Now imagine the outcome. The device that used  to be specialized
for the  playing  of  video games takes  on  different  appearances,
depending upon its intended function. In the garage, the device would
look like shop machinery, with a serious, rugged appearance, impervi-
ous to damage. It would serve as tutor and assistant, displaying auto-
mobile manuals, mechanical drawings,  and  short videos  of the
required  steps  to  maintain  or upgrade  the  auto.  In the  kitchen,  it
matches the decor of kitchen appliances  and becomes a cooking aid
and tutor. In the living room, it fits with the furniture  and  books and
becomes a  reference manual, perhaps  an  encyclopedia, tutor,  and
player of reflective games (such as go, chess, cards, word games). And
for the  student,  it is a source of simulations, experiments,  and exten-
sive exploration of interesting, well-motivated topics, but topics care-

Page content : the eventual  goal—that  is, to the true needs.  The  first  step  in good
behavioral design is to understand  just how people will use a product.
This team had not done even this most elementary set of observations.
There are two  kinds  of product development: enhancement  and
innovation. Enhancement means  to take some existing product  or
service and make it better. Innovation provides  a completely new way
of doing something,  or a  completely new thing to do,  something that
was not possible before.  Of the  two, enhancements are much easier.
Innovations  are  particularly  difficult  to  assess. Before  they  were
introduced,  who would have thought  we needed typewriters, personal
computers, copying machines,  or  cell phones? Answer: Nobody.
Today it  is hard to imagine  life  without these items,  but before they
existed almost  no one but  an  inventor could imagine what purpose
they would serve,  and quite often  the  inventors were wrong. Thomas
Edison thought that  the phonograph would eliminate  the need for let-
ters written  on paper: business people would dictate their thoughts
and mail  the recordings.  The  personal computer  was  so misunder-
stood that several  then-major  computer  manufacturers  completely
dismissed them: some  of those once-large companies  no longer exist.
The telephone  was thought to be an instrument  for  business, and in
the early days, telephone companies tried  to dissuade customers  from
using the phone for mere conversation and gossip.
One cannot evaluate  an innovation  by asking potential customers
for their views.  This requires people  to imagine something they have
no experience with. Their answers, historically, have been notoriously
